# ReactJS Hotels

## Development

###Requirements:

I'm using `npx` so you need `npm +5.2` to use it.

Before use this, you need to install all the dependencies, just run `npm i`, that will do the trick.

### Server

Then, to mount a dev server just run `npm start`, this will mount a express server, some gulp task to assure code quality and a react dev environment.
